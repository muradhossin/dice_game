# Dice Game App

This is very simple Game. You have to roll two dice. Each die has six faces, which contain 
one, two, three, four, five and six spots, respectively. After the dice have come to rest, the sum of the spots on the two upward faces is calculated. 

#### *Game Rules*

- If the sum is 7 or 11 on the first throw, you win.  
- If the sum is 2, 3 or 12 on the first throw (called ‚Äúcraps‚Äù), you lose (i.e., the ‚Äúhouse‚Äù wins). 
- If the sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 on the first throw, that sum becomes your ‚Äúpoint.‚Äù 
- To win,you must continue rolling the dice until you ‚Äúmake your point‚Äù(i.e., roll that samepoint value). 
- You lose by rolling a 7 before making your point.
